The majority of this project was created **before** I knew about using test harnesses.  So the tests are done using `assert` module and mostly logging the results.

Also, the commit history might be a lil fucked up because this was when I was just learning git and also I am using this repo to hone my git skills so I won't be hesitant to fuck it up. :)
